# Data Analysis of global temperature data 
In this project created during my first year of University, I wanted to investigate a data set showing global temperature data to understand how various climate events has affected different regions across the globe.

I began by cleaning up my data set, and adding my data to a suitable data structure that allowed me to easily access the data I needed. I then plotted various aspects of the data to provide visualisation of climate trends over time. This allowed me to identify any outliers in the data and relate this to key real world events.
